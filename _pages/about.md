I am a third-year Ph.D student in the department of Statistics at University of California, Santa Cruz. My advisor is [Prof. Zehang (Richard) Li](https://zehangli.com). I am broadly interested in development and applications of parametric and non-parametric Bayesian models. My current work mainly focus on the development of Bayesian hierarchical models for the inference of prevalence and prediction of individual cause-of-death related to COVID-19. 

I earned my master degree in Statistics at University of California, Davis, advised by [James Sharpnack](https://jsharpna.github.io). After graduation, I worked as a full-stack Software Development Engineer at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us) before pursuing my Ph.D.

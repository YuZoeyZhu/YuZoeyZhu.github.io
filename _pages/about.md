I am a **5th-year Ph.D. candidate** in the **Department of Statistics** at the **University of California, Santa Cruz**, advised by [Prof. Zehang (Richard) Li](https://zehangli.com). My research focuses on the **development and application of parametric and non-parametric Bayesian models**, with an emphasis on **Bayesian latent variable models** for **prevalence estimation** and **cause-of-death prediction** under **domain adaptation** ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=pZsCRpMAAAAJ&inst=1581658869211165550)).

Beyond academia, I have **industry research experience** in **causal inference, reinforcement learning, and large language models (LLMs)**. During my Ph.D., I worked as a **Data Scientist Intern** at **Tencent America** and **Microsoft Azure**, contributing to projects in **treatment effect estimation, online experimentation, and AI/ML infrastructure**.

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned my **M.S. in Statistics** from the **University of California, Davis**, where I was advised by [Prof. James Sharpnack](https://jsharpna.github.io). Before transitioning into research, I worked as a **full-stack Software Development Engineer** at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us), gaining hands-on experience in **software engineering, system design, and large-scale data processing**.

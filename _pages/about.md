I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, advised by [Prof. Zehang (Richard) Li](https://zehangli.com). My research focuses on the development and application of parametric and non-parametric Bayesian models, with an emphasis on Bayesian latent variable models for prevalence estimation and cause-of-death prediction under domain adaptation ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=pZsCRpMAAAAJ&inst=1581658869211165550)).

Beyond academia, I have industry research experience in causal inference, reinforcement learning, and large language models (LLMs). During my Ph.D., I worked as a Data Scientist Intern at Tencent America and Microsoft Azure, contributing to projects in treatment effect estimation, online experimentation, and AI/ML infrastructure.

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned my M.S. in Statistics from the University of California, Davis, where I was advised by [Prof. James Sharpnack](https://jsharpna.github.io). Before transitioning into research, I worked as a full-stack Software Development Engineer at ThoughtWorks, gaining hands-on experience in software engineering, system design, and large-scale data processing.

## Hierarchical Latent Class Models for Mortality Surveillance

### Overview
Monitoring causes of death is crucial for understanding disease burdens and shaping public health interventions. In many low-resource settings, **verbal autopsy (VA)** is the primary tool for cause-of-death surveillance, relying on structured interviews with caregivers of the deceased. However, existing VA models often require **extensive domain knowledge** or **large labeled datasets**, making them **ill-suited for emerging diseases** with rapidly evolving epidemiological patterns.

### Our Contribution
In our research, we propose a **Bayesian hierarchical latent class model** that accounts for **partially verified VA data**, enabling robust **cause-of-death estimation** under real-world data constraints. Key innovations include:

- **Hierarchical Latent Class Modeling**  
  - Captures the joint distribution of symptoms and their shifts over time and across subpopulations.
  - Accounts for **selective verification bias**, a common issue where cause-of-death verification is **not randomly assigned**.

- **Structured Priors for Improved Estimation**  
  - Incorporates **domain adaptation techniques** to refine estimates for **small subpopulations**.
  - Allows for **flexible borrowing of information** across related demographic groups.

- **Application to COVID-19 Surveillance in Brazil**  
  - We apply our model to **COVID-19 mortality data** in Brazil (2021), demonstrating how traditional models suffer from bias under selective verification.
  - Our method produces **more accurate prevalence estimates** compared to existing approaches.

### Why This Matters
- **Adaptable to Future Public Health Crises**  
  - The framework can be **quickly deployed for new diseases** where **symptom-cause relationships are initially unknown**.
  
- **More Reliable Mortality Estimates**  
  - Reduces **bias** from non-random cause-of-death verification, critical for **global disease surveillance**.

- **Bridging Statistical Innovation with Real-World Impact**  
  - This research integrates **Bayesian inference**, **semi-supervised learning**, and **domain adaptation** to enhance **public health decision-making**.

## Treatment Effect Estimation in Dynamic Network Environments

### Overview
Online multiplayer games introduce **complex interactions** among players, making it difficult to assess the true impact of game features. Traditional **A/B testing** methods, which assume **no interference among units (SUTVA)**, fail in these settings due to the **dynamic and ephemeral network structures** formed during gameplay.

In this research, we address the challenges of **network interference** in online gaming experiments and propose a **novel treatment effect estimator** that enables **post-hoc interference adjustment** in randomized experiments.

### Key Challenges
- **Dynamic Network Structure**  
  - Unlike traditional social networks, online gaming networks **continuously change** as players match into transient teams.
  - Players may participate in **multiple games**, making their exposure to treatment **vary across sessions**.

- **Violation of SUTVA**  
  - Player experience is **influenced by teammates**, causing **spillover effects** that bias traditional A/B testing.
  - Treatment assignment may be **overwritten by team formation rules**, altering true exposure.

- **Scalability and Feasibility**  
  - Running **cluster-based** or **hierarchical randomized experiments** is **computationally expensive** and **logistically impractical** in large-scale online games.

### Our Contribution
To address these challenges, we propose a **causal inference framework** specifically designed for **dynamic online gaming environments**.

- **Novel Treatment Effect Estimation Under Network Interference**  
  - We develop a **general exposure mapping** function that models how treatment spreads through **dynamic team formations**.
  - Our approach allows **post-hoc adjustment of interference** while preserving the simplicity of **randomized experimental designs**.

- **Robust Statistical Estimators**  
  - We introduce an estimator that accounts for **varying levels of exposure** to treatment.
  - The method leverages **Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)** to correct for biased exposure distributions.

- **Empirical Validation with Real Gaming Data**  
  - We test our framework on a **Tencent mobile gaming experiment** involving **58,565 players** over two weeks.
  - Results show that **naÃ¯ve estimators** significantly **underestimate treatment effects**, while our method **corrects for interference bias**.

### Why This Matters
- **Generalizable to Other Dynamic Network Settings**  
  - The framework applies beyond gaming to areas like **social media, online marketplaces, and ad campaign experiments**.

- **Reduces Experimentation Costs**  
  - Enables **more efficient experimental designs** without needing **complex cluster-based interventions**.

- **Improves Decision-Making in A/B Testing**  
  - More reliable treatment effect estimates help **game developers** optimize **new feature rollouts**.
